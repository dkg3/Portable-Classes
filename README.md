# Portable-Classes  

Portable Classes is an iOS app intended for high school and college students who wish to keep all their information pertaining to their classes and be able to share it with others in one easy to use, convenient app. Users can organize their content by semesters, then by classes, then by class features like deadlines, notes, pictures, and flash cards. They can add and remove as much content as they would like, and the best part is they can share it with one another. There is a map with every public user, and each oneâ€™s content is accessible to everyone else.
